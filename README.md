Context

All Life Bank is aiming to strengthen its focus on credit card customers in the upcoming financial year. According to insights from the marketing research team, there is significant potential to improve market penetration. In response, the marketing team plans to launch personalized campaigns—both to attract new customers and to offer more value to existing ones.

The research also revealed that customer satisfaction with the bank’s support services is relatively low. As a result, the operations team is looking to enhance the service delivery model to ensure quicker and more efficient resolution of customer queries. To support these initiatives, both the heads of marketing and operations have turned to the Data Science team for assistance.
Objective

Segment the existing credit card customer base by analyzing their spending behaviors and interaction history with the bank, with the goal of enabling more targeted marketing and improved customer service.
